            <h2>What is Lunar New Year?</h2>
            <p>In Vietnamese, Tet means the Vietnamese Lunar New Year and is considered the greatest and most major holiday in a year. More than celebrating New Year, its essence is really to reunite family members and pay respect to ancestors for a prosperous new beginning.</p><br>
            <p>I remember, as a kid, Tet was like magic: the whole neighborhood would be decked out in red and yellow, and the streets would smell of incense and fresh flowers. My family would get together a few days before Tet to clean the house-what they called "sweep away bad luck"-and make special dishes, such as bánh chưng and bánh tét.</p><br>
            <p>Yet, the best part about Tet is getting lì xì from your elders. Really, however, Tet isn't all about gifts. Family, tradition, and new beginnings are just about the fireworks, big family meals, or maybe just the sound of relatives you have not heard for some time-instantly warming your heart with their guffaws and filling your heart with happiness.</p><br>
